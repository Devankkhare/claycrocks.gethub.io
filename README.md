Brief write-up of project 
An E-Commerce website which will allow the merchant to advertise and sell their goods on the internet. This will enable 
the merchant to access the vast user database on the world wide web. 
We will connect with local clay pot vendors and provide them a platform to showcase their products. 
Problem Statement 
It is an initiative towards “Vocal for Local” where it connects local vendors with big merchants & provides income 
for both the sectors. E-commerce provides an easy way to sell products to a large customer base. However, there 
is a lot of competition among multiple e-commerce sites. When users land on an e-commerce site, they expect to 
find what they are looking for quickly and easily. Also, users are not sure about the brands or the actual products 
they want to purchase. They have a very broad idea about what they want to buy. Many customers nowadays 
search for their products on Google rather than visiting specific e-commerce sites. They believe that Google will 
take them to the e-commerce sites that have their product. 
The purpose of any e-commerce website is to help customers narrow down their broad ideas and enable them to 
finalize the products.
